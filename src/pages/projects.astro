        I <b>love</b> building websites. Here are all the noteworthy (and not so noteworthy) things I've worked on.
        Many were <span class="font-bold bg-blue-200 text-blue-900 px-1 py-0.5 rounded-sm">solo projects</span>,
        while a bunch were on a{' '}
        <span class="font-bold bg-green-200 text-green-900 px-1 py-0.5 rounded-sm">team</span> - some employed.

        Scroll down to the bottom to see the most embarrassing projects I made in high school. ðŸ™ˆ We all have to

        (if it was a paid job) and how I got here.

        Icon size indicates how "important" I thought that project is (or was) in my life at the time and how
        involved I was.
